I am a backend engineer with a passion for building reliable and maintainable server-side systems. I primarily work with Java and Spring to design and develop
  RESTful APIs and scalable server architectures. I care deeply about clean code,
  solid design principles, and writing software that lasts.

```java
@Bean
public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager(AuthenticationConfiguration authConfig) throws Exception {
    return authConfig.getAuthenticationManager();
}
```
